This upgrade adds markdown formatting support to AI responses in the ParseQri frontend, making the AI responses more visually appealing and easier to read.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

1. **Added Dependencies**
   - `react-markdown` - For rendering markdown content
   - `remark-gfm` - For GitHub Flavored Markdown support (tables, strikethrough, etc.)

2. **Updated QueryResult Component** (`frontend/src/components/QueryResult.tsx`)
   - Added markdown rendering with custom component styling
   - Integrated syntax highlighting for code blocks
   - Added proper dark mode support for all markdown elements
   - Custom styling for:
     - Headers (h1, h2, h3)
     - Paragraphs with proper spacing
     - Lists (ordered and unordered)
     - Tables with responsive design
     - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
     - Blockquotes with custom styling
     - Links with proper hover effects
     - Strong and emphasis text

3. **Added Test Component** (`frontend/src/components/MarkdownTestResponse.tsx`)
   - Demonstrates markdown formatting capabilities
   - Shows various markdown elements in action
   - Accessible at `/markdown-test` route

4. **Added Like/Dislike Functionality**
   - Added thumbs up/down buttons to each answer section
   - Buttons positioned in bottom-right corner of answer area
   - Interactive state management (liked/disliked)
   - Smooth animations and hover effects
   - Proper dark mode styling

### Backend Changes

1. **Updated Response Formatting Agent** (`ParseQri_Backend/ParseQri_Agent/TextToSQL_Agent/agents/response_formatting.py`)
   - Modified the LLM prompt to generate markdown-formatted responses
   - Added instructions for:
     - Using **bold** for emphasis
     - Creating bullet points and numbered lists
     - Using tables for structured data
     - Adding headers for organization
     - Using inline code for specific values
     - Proper markdown syntax usage

## Features

### Supported Markdown Elements

- **Headers** (H1, H2, H3) with proper hierarchy
- **Bold** and *italic* text formatting
- **Lists** (ordered and unordered) with proper spacing
- **Tables** with responsive design and dark mode support
- **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting
- **Inline code** with custom styling
- **Blockquotes** with custom borders and background
- **Links** with hover effects
- **Horizontal rules** for section separation
- **Like/Dislike buttons** for user feedback on responses

### Dark Mode Support

All markdown elements are properly styled for both light and dark modes:
- Proper color contrast
- Consistent styling across themes
- Readable text in all conditions

## Usage

### For Users
AI responses will now automatically display with rich formatting:
- Key numbers and findings will be **bold**
- Multiple items will be presented in organized lists
- Complex data will be shown in tables
- Responses will have clear section headers
- Code and technical terms will be highlighted
- Users can provide feedback with like/dislike buttons

### For Developers
The markdown rendering is handled automatically by the `QueryResult` component. No additional configuration is needed.

## Testing

To test the markdown formatting:
1. Start the frontend development server
2. Navigate to `/markdown-test` in your browser
3. View the sample formatted response to see all markdown elements in action

## Performance

The markdown rendering is optimized for performance:
- Uses react-markdown with efficient rendering
- Syntax highlighting is only applied to code blocks
- Responsive design ensures good performance on all devices

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Math equation support (using KaTeX)
- Mermaid diagram support
- Custom emoji support
- Advanced table features (sorting, filtering)
- Export to PDF/HTML functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Markdown not rendering**: Ensure react-markdown is properly installed
2. **Code blocks not highlighted**: Check that react-syntax-highlighter is working
3. **Dark mode styling issues**: Verify Tailwind CSS dark mode classes are applied

### Dependencies

Make sure these packages are installed:
```bash
npm install react-markdown remark-gfm
```

The following packages should already be available:
- `react-syntax-highlighter` (for code highlighting)
- `@tailwindcss/typography` (for prose styling)

## Impact

This upgrade significantly improves the user experience by:
- Making AI responses more readable and professional
- Providing better visual hierarchy with headers and lists
- Highlighting important information with bold text
- Organizing complex data in tables
- Maintaining consistency across light and dark themes

The changes are backward compatible and will not affect existing functionality.
